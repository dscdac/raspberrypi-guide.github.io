### The Rasberry Pi Guide
This github page host the open access website [http://raspberrypi-guide.github.io](http://raspberrypi-guide.github.io). The website is developed and maintained by Dr Jolle Jolles as part of a bigger effort to help researchers take up and integrate the Raspberry Pi in their work. It accompanies the academic review paper ([https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13652](Broad-scale Applications of the Raspberry Pi: A Review and Guide for Biologists), Jolles, 2021) that documents the number of applications of Raspberry Piâ€™s in the biological sciences and tries to help overcome the lack of broad uptake.

If you see any issues with the website, please post an issue on the [https://github.com/raspberrypi-guide/raspberrypi-guide.github.io/issues](issue page). If you have recommendations for new guides, please also raise that as a new issue. For help with the Rasberry Pi, please leave a comment on the relevant tutorial on the website. Thanks!
