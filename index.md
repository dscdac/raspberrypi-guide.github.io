# The Raspberry Pi Guide for Scientists and anyone else
{: .fs-9 }
---
The Raspberry Pi is a widely popular and highly diverse, low-cost, single-board computer and a great research tool for scientists working in the biological sciences and other domains.

[![Raspberry Pi Review paper](/assets/images/jolles-et-al-frontpage.jpg?style=smallimgleft)](/assets/images/jolles-et-al-frontpage.jpg)

This website accompanies the [preprint](http://) *Broad-scale Applications with the Raspberry Pi: A Review and Guide for Biologists* and provides a resource hub specifically aimed at scientists to provide guidance setting-up and integrating the Raspberry Pi in their work. A wide range of tutorials can be found via the menu on the left, as well as a [FAQ](docs/9-FAQ.html). Additional guides can be found on the website of the Raspberry Pi Foundation: [raspberrypi.org/documentation/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/) https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation

Currently the website hosts a total of XX guides, with more guides being added all the time. The best place to start is to follow the [Main Raspberry Pi guide](http://).

{make clear this website was created with scientists in mind and highlight thereby how it is different from other websites, such as no adds. Aim to provide concise, easy to follow guides. link to the very detailed starting documentation book by RPi foundation.}


## About me
[![Jolle workshop](/assets/images/jolle-raspberrypi-workshop.png?style=smallimgright)](/assets/images/jolle-raspberrypi-workshop.png)
I am Jolle Jolles, a researcher at the Center for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications ([CREAF](http://creaf.cat)). [My research](http://jollejolles.com) is focused on the role of individual heterogeneity in animal communities and its consequences across social and ecological scales. With my work I have been pushing novel empirical approaches to the study of animal behaviour and more broadly have been a strong proponent of the use of Raspberry Pi's and give workshops, maintain this website, and have written a [detailed review](http://) about the many potential research applications possible with the Raspberry Pi. Find out more about my research via my website: [http://jollejolles.com](http://jollejolles.com), on Twitter: [@jollewjolles](http://twitter.com/jollewjolles), or Instagram: [@jollethebiologist](http://instagram.com/jollethebiologist).
