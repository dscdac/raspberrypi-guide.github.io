## The website
The website is developed and maintained by Dr Jolle Jolles as part of a bigger effort to help researchers to take up and integrate Raspberry Pi's in their work, and accompanies the academic review paper ([*Broad-scale Applications of the Raspberry Pi: A Review and Guide for Biologists*](the-paper)) that documents the broad uptake of Raspberry Pi's in the biological sciences.

The website has been carefully developed (hosted open source on [github pages](https://github.com/raspberrypi-guide/raspberrypi-guide.github.io)) to provide key guides that are concise, easy-to-follow, and without any distractions. The website is completely free from adds and I do not have any financial interests in promoting the Raspberry Pi; I created this website purely because I like the Raspberry Pi and think it should be helpful to others. Although the website was developed with scientists in mind, it should be helpful to anyone using or wanting to use these highly versatile little computers. The best place to start is the follow along with the [overview guide](/overview-guide).

## About me
[![Jolle workshop](/assets/images/jolle-raspberrypi-workshop.jpg?style=smallimgright)](/assets/images/jolle-raspberrypi-workshop.jpg) I am Jolle Jolles, a behavioural ecologist at the Center for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications ([CREAF](http://creaf.cat)). I study the behaviour of individuals and groups of animals to try and understand the role of phenotypic variation in animal communities and its consequences across ecological scales. I am a passionate and long-term user of Raspberry Pi's, and have used them as a central component of my work since 2014. Besides creating this website and writing the detailed [review article](http://), I also give Raspberry Pi workshops for fellow scientists. You can find out more about my research on my website ([jollejolles.com](http://jollejolles.com)), Twitter ([@jollewjolles](http://twitter.com/jollewjolles)), and Instagram ([@jollethebiologist](http://instagram.com/jollethebiologist)).

## Contact
I hope you find this website useful! If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions or just want to say hi, it would be great to hear from you. You can leave comments on the specific guides or [send me an email](mailto:j.w.jolles@gmail.com). Please also consider [citing the paper](the-paper).
