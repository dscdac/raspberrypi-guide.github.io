Hi, I am Jolle Jolles, the guy behind this website. I am a research fellow at CREAF. For more information about my research, see my [academic website](http://jollejolles.com) and my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=VCZqbK4AAAAJ).

If you need further help running *pirecorder* you can email me [j.w.jolles@gmail.com](mailto:j.w.jolles@gmail.com). I also always like hearing from you when *pirecorder* has been useful for you! For bugs or feature requests it is easiest if you post an issue on the GitHub issue tracker [here](https://github.com/jollejolles/pirecorder/issues).
