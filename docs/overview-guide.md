## Setting up and configuring
Make sure you have the [right hardware](getting-started/choosing-raspberry-pi-hardware.html). 2) [Install the operating system](http://) on the micro-SD card or use a pre-installed [NOOBS card](https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs/blob/master/README.md). If you do not have a keyboard, mouse and screen you need to follow a couple more steps to [create a headless setup](http://). Plug-in the SD-card and connect the power to start your Raspberry Pi for the first time. Now it is time to generally [configure your Raspberry Pi](http://), such as to change the default password and hostname, make sure everything is up-to-date, and to enable various options.

Getting to know the system, [working with Linux](http://), the [Raspberry Pi desktop](http://). Also if needed, read up on [working with the command line](http://).
{Here also integrate guides from RaspberyPi foundation website}. https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-using

## Connecting and networking
If you want to connect remotely, make sure your Raspberry Pi has a [wireless](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/README.md) or [ethernet connection](http://) and read the guides on how to connect [via SSH](http://) and [via VNC](http://). You may want to [create a static ip address](http://) for better connectivity or even set up the Raspberry Pi as a [wireless access point](http://) to make it possible to connect remotely even when no other network is available. It is good to make some changes at this stage to [increase your Raspberry Pi security](http://).

## Filesharing
It is likely you may want to share files with your Raspberry Pi. Read up on how to [enable filesharing](http://) with Mac, Windows, and Linux and learn how to [mount an external drive](http://) on the Raspberry Pi. To synchronise files between different computers or over the internet, read the [file synchronisation guide](http://).

## Programming
[terminal stuff from paper] If you are planning on working with Python, it is a good idea to [create virtual environments](http://) and you may wish to [install OpenCV](http://). You may also wish to learn how to [run scripts at boot](http://) or [print statements at boot and shutdown](http://), such as for on-time monitoring. I also explain how to set up [email notifications](http://), [sms notifications](http://), or even [slack notifications](http://).

## Image and video recording
If you are planning to use the Raspberry Pi for image and video recording, [this beginner tutorial](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera) on how to use the Raspberry Pi camera is quite helpful. If you want to use a webcam, follow [this guide](http://). There are various ways to record with the Raspberry Pi, including [raspicam](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/README.md), [picamera](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/), [pirecorder](https://github.com/jollejolles/pirecorder), or other interface.

## Power solutions
When working with a non-mains powered Raspberry Pi, you may want to read the [power consumption tricks](http://) and learn how to work with the [PiJuice](https://uk.pi-supply.com/collections/pijuice) and automatically [manage uptime of the Raspberry Pi](http://).
