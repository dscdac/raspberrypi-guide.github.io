## What is Twilio
[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) is a communications platform designed to link and engage with users from a number of different platforms such as Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Voice and many more. It allows users to create their own applications using a number of different programming language and provided examples. Here we will use it to send SMS messages.

Twilio is a paid platform, but initial sign up under the free Trial will give you credit of $15.50 to send and receive messages, which cost less than a cent. Thereafter you can use a pay-as-you-go service to top up your credit.

## Create a Twilio Account
Head over to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio to sign up for a free trial account. You will need to verify your email address and personal phone number for security measures before you can try Twilio. You will also see the pre-loaded balance in the Dashboard to test out some of Twilioâ€™s functionality. You will not be charged for Twilio phone numbers until you upgrade your account. Note that messages sent in trial will begin with "Sent from a Twilio Trial Account".

Now to be able to send text message, you will need a register a phone number in your account. To do so, go to https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming.

## Install Twilio
To install Twilio on the Raspberry Pi simply open up a terminal window and type the following command:

```
sudo pip3 install twilio
```

## Using Twilio
Now to use Twilio, First get your account SID and Auth token from [twilio.com/console](https://www.twilio.com/console) and then open a new file:

```
nano sendsms.py
```

and add the following code:

```
from twilio.rest import Client

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'AC9ba3ef126c7365e888ab4a1de527f1e9' # replace with your Account SID
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = '5451132aaf117b6ac81cd071742cdaa2' # replace with your Auth Token
TWILIO_PHONE_SENDER = "+34 34657042321" # replace with the phone number you registered in twilio
TWILIO_PHONE_RECIPIENT = "+34657042321" # replace with your phone number

def send_text_alert(alert_str):
    """Sends an SMS text alert."""
    client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
    message = client.messages.create(
        to=TWILIO_PHONE_RECIPIENT,
        from_=TWILIO_PHONE_SENDER,
        body="Your text message here")
    print(message.sid)
```

To exit press `ctrl+x`, then `y`, and `Enter`.

## Use hidden credentials
Using the above script we hardcode the credentials. This is fine to get started but not very safe. A much better option is to use environment variables to keep them secret before deploying to production.

Follow my general guide [here](http://) and then adapt your Python script above to use the following code:

```
import os
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = os.environ['TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID']
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ['TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN']
```

That's it! Save your script and run it with `python sendsms.py` and you should receive your first text in seconds.
