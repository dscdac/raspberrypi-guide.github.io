## The Raspberry Pi as a research tool
The field of Biology has seen tremendous technological progress in recent years, fuelled by the exponential growth in processing power and high-level computing, and the rise of global information sharing.

Low-cost single-board computers are predicted to be one of the key technological advancements to further revolutionise this field. So far, however an overview of current uptake of these devices and a general guide to help researchers integrate them in their work has been missing.

To help researchers (further) integrate Raspberry Piâ€™s in their work, in this paper I provide a review of existing applications across the biological domain. This shows that already a hugely diverse range of applications of the Raspberry Pi exists, aiding biologists in the lab, the field, and in the classroom.

I also provide guidelines, recommendations, and considerations about using the Raspberry Pi, including setting-up and configuration, networking, power solutions, media recording, using electronic sensors and controllers, and data storage and transferring. This dedicated accompanying website provides further step-by-step tutorials.

I believe low-cost micro-computers like the Raspberry Pi are a powerful tool that can help transform research and democratise science. I hope that my paper and this website will help scientists with their work to thereby ultimately lead to new scientific advances, from the micro- to the macro-scale.
