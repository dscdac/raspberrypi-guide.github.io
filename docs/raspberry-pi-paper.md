## About this website
This website accompanies the [preprint](http://) *Broad-scale Applications with the Raspberry Pi: A Review and Guide for Biologists* and provides a resource hub specifically aimed at scientists to provide guidance setting-up and integrating the Raspberry Pi in their work. A wide range of tutorials can be found via the menu on the left, as well as a [FAQ](http://).

This website is developed and maintained by Dr Jolle Jolles as part of a bigger effort to help researchers, especially in the biological sciences, to take up and integrate Raspberry Pi's in their work. It provides a compendium of tutorials that should help both beginners and more advanced users with most aspects for working with the Raspberry Pi.

For an overview of version changes see the [CHANGELOG](http://) and for detailed changes see the [commits page](http://). If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions you can leave a comment on the [contact page](http://).
